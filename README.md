Mentalizing Signatures: Replication Code
===================================================

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline for the study:

    AÃ§Ä±l, D., ..., Koban, L., et al. (2025). "Brain neuromarkers predict self- and other-related mentalizing across adult, clinical, and developmental samples". Preprint available at bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.10.642438

This code reproduces all analyses and figures reported in the manuscript. The pipeline includes:

- Training four cross-validated SVM classifiers of mentalizing processes
- Testing classifier predictions in six independent datasets
- Testing group differences (patient vs. healthy controls) in signature expressions as well as associations with age
- Training and validations ROI classifiers
- Generating figures and tables for both main text and supplementary material

ðŸ’¡**Note:**
Mentalizing Signatures are shared in /weight_maps as images  to be used and tested in future studies. 
ðŸ§  Self-RS to predict self-related mentalizing, Other-RS to predict other-related mentalizing, Mentalizing Signature (MS) to predict both, and Self-vs-Other (Self-RS) Signature to predict self- vs. other-condition.
 

Requirements
------------

- MATLAB R2022b or newer
- The following MATLAB toolboxes are required for analyses:
  - CanlabCore Toolbox (https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore)
  - SPM12
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
  - Signal Processing Toolbox
- For visualizations:
  - DataViz Toolbox for Matlab (https://github.com/povilaskarvelis/DataViz)
  - R Software (for generating figures of age associations)
